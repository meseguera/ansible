Using Ansibleâ€™s pull method
The way we set up our Ansible configuration in the previous section works very well if we have a list
of specific servers that we want it to manage. To add a new server, we create the user account and set
up the SSH configuration on the new host, and then add it to the inventory file. If we decommission
that server, we simply remove it from the inventory file. This works well in a static environment,
where servers you deploy typically stay around for a while. In a dynamic environment, though, this
may not work as well.
